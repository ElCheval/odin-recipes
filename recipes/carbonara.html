    <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>Pasta Carbonara is a simple dish consisting of pasta, a sauce made by combining fresh eggs with pecorino romano
        cheese (though Parmesan or Grana Padano are also used), and some sort of cured meat (traditionally guanciale, but pancetta
        and bacon are usual replacements). The dish originated in Rome, hence the name "Romano", and is said to have been the meal
        of choice for blue-collar workers in the early 1900s.
      </p>

      <p>
        Despite it's Roman origins, the dish has become quite popular in the Western hemisphere, as a staple of Italian-American cuisine.
        Traditionalists sometimes wince at Western versions of Carbonara, mostly at the addition of non-traditional ingredients such as garlic or the
        aforementioned bacon. Nevertheless–regardless of how you decide to do it–Carbonara is a dish that will leave both your heart and belly
        full.
